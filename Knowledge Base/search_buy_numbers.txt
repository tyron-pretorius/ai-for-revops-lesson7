Searching, Purchasing & Ordering Phone Numbers (DIDs)

Number Search
On the Search & Buy Numbers page, you will be provided with 5 search types:

* Country (Required)
* Features
* Type
* Search By
* Area Code

Country
Choose the country in the dropdown in which you want to find a phone number. This is the only required field when searching for a phone number.

Features
Choose one or multiple features to ensure that the number you'll be purchasing is aligned with your use case:

Number Type
Choose the number type you're looking to purchase:

Local Numbers
Choosing Local Numbers enables you to search by Area Code, City/Region or State/Province:

Search by Area Code
Searching by area code allows you to search via the Area Code dropdown or to directly type in the area code that you're looking for.

Search by City/Region
Searching by City or Region enables you to type in the City, Region or Rate Center that you're looking for. While typing, the portal will autogenerate options for you to choose from:

Search by State/Province:
Searching by State/Province allows you to search for the state or province you are interested in (US only for now). You can choose from the dropdown or type the state you're interested in:

Toll-Free Numbers
Choose a country of your choice, choose Toll-free as the Type, and specify patterns that the toll-free numbers should contain under the Advanced Search feature:

Advanced Search
You can use the Advanced Search feature for both the Toll-free and Local number types. This feature enables you to:
* Search for vanity numbers or specific digits within a phone number
* Specify how many Consecutive Numbers you'd like (555-7345, 555-7346, 555-7347…)
* Specify your Results limit (currently at 100 results max)
* Toggle Best Effort searches, so we can return numbers in a rate center or area code close to the one you've chosen – should we not be able to find any that meet your criteria
* Enable Quickship to return a list of toll-free numbers that have their voice/fax capabilities instantly provisioned, so you can start to receive inbound calls immediately
* Toggle Reservable Numbers providing you the ability to return searches for numbers that have not been previously owned. By default, if you've recently deleted a number and searched for a similar number, Telnyx will return the deleted number as a result. We hold deleted numbers on your account for up to 15 days before they're vetted and released back into the general inventory. If you don't want to retrieve recently deleted numbers, please enable "Exclude held numbers".
* Telnyx Bundles search instead for a bundle that contains numbers, features and minutes included. Our search results will exclude premium NPA TNs.

Number Ordering
Happy with your search results? Click on the Add to Cart button to add your phone number/s to your cart for purchase.

Cart
Your number orders are accessible via your cart, showing the numbers you've chosen to purchase. You're able to empty your cart or individually delete a phone number by clicking on the trash icon associated with the number. You are also able to select a Connection or Messaging Profile you'd like these numbers to be assigned to automatically once the order is processed.

We show you the Upfront Cost (one-time activation) and Monthly Cost (recurring) for each number. On the right, you'll see your Order Summary with the order total and the button to Place Order. The order total will be deducted from your balance.

Orders are final, and we do not provide refunds if you purchased a number by mistake. Please make sure to review the order summary completely before proceeding.

We recommend only ordering up to 100 numbers at a time through the cart. Orders over this amount may result in purchase failures (which you are not charged for) or Connections/Messaging Profiles not being assigned correctly. We're continuously working on improving the scale of our ordering and assignment system. If you'd like to order more than 100 phone numbers, please contact our sales team.

Orders
After you've placed your order, you will be brought to the Orders Page. Each order you've ever processed through our system will be listed here. You'll see the order date and time, along with the quantity of numbers purchased per order. Additionally, you can click the order ID or "details" to re-check your order and verify what numbers were purchased.

How do I delete a number?
Visit the My Numbers Page and use the search filters to filter for the number you want to delete. Find the number you'd like to delete and click on the trash icon on the right. Once a number is deleted, monthly recurring charges will no longer apply.

How do I restore or repurchase my deleted numbers?
You have 15 days to repurchase numbers you may have accidentally deleted. Numbers deleted will reincur charges, and resubmission of documentation will be required if they're international numbers. A prorated monthly recurring charge will be applied depending on your repurchase date.

To restore the deleted numbers back to your account, use our Advanced Search on our Search & Buy Numbers Page:
* Specify the Country
* Search by Area Code
* Under the Advanced Search feature, set Phone Number to Contains
* Input the number you're looking to purchase
* Click Search Numbers
You may have to wait a couple of minutes after deleting the number for the number to return as a search result. If you're unable to see the deleted numbers in the search results, and it's been less than 15 days since you deleted the number, please email numbering@telnyx.com so they can help verify and assist with the number restoration.

International Requirements
When ordering numbers outside of North America, you may be prompted to provide more information to comply with local regulatory requirements by a set deadline. You can find a list of requirements for each country here.

Numbers that require further documentation will be displayed with a warning note on your portal.

Once purchased, head over to the Orders Page and click on the phone number you've purchased with the Pending status.
Clicking on that phone number takes you to the Orders Requirement page specific to that number where you can add the required documentation. Requirements can generally include, but are not limited to:
* Contact Information
* Address matching the phone number purchased
* Proof of identification
* Company registration certificate
You may also start a conversation with our numbering team for any inquiries about documentation requirements for the phone number you purchased using the Communications functionality on the same page:
Please note: Any number without proper documentation uploaded may not be activated, and inbound call capabilities may not work as expected.
