Receiving SMS on your Telnyx number

Prerequisites for Receiving SMS
Make sure you've configured your account, such as purchasing a number, creating a messaging profile, and associating that messaging profile with that number.

Receiving SMS on Telnyx
First of all, there is no provision on the Telnyx portal where you can receive the SMS.
In order to receive SMS on your Telnyx purchased number, you need to attach a webhook to the number's respective messaging profile.

So let's take this example DID which is connected to a Telnyx messaging profile.

Now, in the messaging profile section, you need to attach a webhook, as highlighted in the green box. To do this, go to Messaging > Programmable Messaging, select the messaging profile, and then select Inbound.

Webhook can be customized and has to be set up by the customer, however, for this demo, we have generated a webhook from this website https://webhook.site/

Once the webhook is saved in the messaging profile, the content of your incoming SMS to Telnyx number can be seen in the webhook.
